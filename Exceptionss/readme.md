#What is an exception?
An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. It 
is  a type of error that occurs during runtime.

##Exception handling.
Exception handling is a mechanism that developers use to manage runtime errors effectively
by using mechanisms like try-catch block, finally block,throwing exceptions,custom exception
handling.

###Explaining Try-catch and Finally blocks

*Try block-> The try block is responsible for trying to execute a program, if the flow of the program
is normal it will run normally, otherwise the catch block will take care of it. It is like saying 
bro I'm going to run this program, but if anything goes wrong you'll take care of it.

*Catch block-> The catch block contains the code that is executed when something goes wrong inside the try
block.

*Finally block-> This block is executed always, this block is executed when there's an exception and when
there's not an exception. to see how it works I will provide a better explanation with code.
